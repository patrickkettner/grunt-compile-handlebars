## Documentation
### Who
patrick kettner - a web developer who consistently worked with large static data sets.

### What
grunt-compile-handlebars takes in a handlebars tempalte (and optionally static pre and post html), runs a dataset over it, and outputs static html.

### Where
inside of a grunt task. I assume you know what gruntjs is, but if not - gruntjs.com

### When
this questions doesn't even make sense

### How
Inside your grunt.js file:

```javascript
'compile-handlebars': {
    development: {
        template: 'index.handlebars',
        output: 'dist/index.html',
        templateData: {
            foo: 'bar'
        }
    },
    staging: {
        template: 'index.handlebars',
        output: 'dist/index.html',
        templateData: '<json:settings/staging.json>'
    }
}
```

### Why
I had to work with several hundred repeated data structures that never changed. Keeping them all in html was silly, but pushing out a template engine for the end user to compile the same information multiple times was even sillier. This allows you to have your templated cake and eat it too.
